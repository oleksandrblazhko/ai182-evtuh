|0|Brower-Web-Application-Request|Denial of Service|An adversary can perform action on behalf of other user due to lack of controls against cross domain requests|Failure to restrict requests originating from third party domains may result in unauthorized actions or access of data
|1|Brower-Web-Application-Request|Elevation of Privileges|An adversary may bypass critical steps or perform actions on behalf of other users (victims) due to improper validation logic|Failure to restrict the privileges and access rights to the application to individuals who require the privileges or access rights may result into unauthorized use of data due to inappropriate rights settings and validation.
|2|Brower-Web-Application-Request|Information Disclosure|An adversary can reverse weakly encrypted or hashed content|An adversary can reverse weakly encrypted or hashed content
|3|Brower-Web-Application-Request|Information Disclosure|An adversary may gain access to sensitive data from log files|An adversary may gain access to sensitive data from log files
|4|Brower-Web-Application-Request|Information Disclosure|An adversary may gain access to unmasked sensitive data such as credit card numbers|An adversary may gain access to unmasked sensitive data such as credit card numbers
|5|Brower-Web-Application-Request|Repudiation|Attacker can deny the malicious act and remove the attack foot prints leading to repudiation issues|Proper logging of all security events and user actions builds traceability in a system and denies any possible repudiation issues. In the absence of proper auditing and logging controls, it would become impossible to implement any accountability in a system
|6|Brower-Web-Application-Request|Spoofing|An adversary can get access to a user's session due to improper logout and timeout|The session cookies is the identifier by which the server knows the identity of current user for each incoming request. If the attacker is able to steal the user token he would be able to access all user data and perform all actions on behalf of user.
|7|Brower-Web-Application-Request|Spoofing|An adversary can get access to a user's session due to insecure coding practices|The session cookies is the identifier by which the server knows the identity of current user for each incoming request. If the attacker is able to steal the user token he would be able to access all user data and perform all actions on behalf of user.
|8|Brower-Web-Application-Request|Spoofing|An adversary can spoof the target web application due to insecure TLS certificate configuration|Ensure that TLS certificate parameters are configured with correct values
|9|Brower-Web-Application-Request|Tampering|An adversary can deface the target web application by injecting malicious code or uploading dangerous files|Website defacement is an attack on a website where the attacker changes the visual appearance of the site or a webpage. 
|10|Brower-Web-Application-Request|Tampering|An attacker steals messages off the network and replays them in order to steal a user's session|An attacker steals messages off the network and replays them in order to steal a user's session
|11|Brower-Web-Application-Request|Tampering|An adversary can gain access to sensitive data by performing SQL injection through Web App|SQL injection is an attack in which malicious code is inserted into strings that are later passed to an instance of SQL Server for parsing and execution. The primary form of SQL injection consists of direct insertion of code into user-input variables that are concatenated with SQL commands and executed. A less direct attack injects malicious code into strings that are destined for storage in a table or as metadata. When the stored strings are subsequently concatenated into a dynamic SQL command, the malicious code is executed. 
|12|DB-Server-Web-Application-Response|Information Disclosure|An adversary can reverse weakly encrypted or hashed content|An adversary can reverse weakly encrypted or hashed content
|13|DB-Server-Web-Application-Response|Information Disclosure|An adversary may gain access to sensitive data from log files|An adversary may gain access to sensitive data from log files
|14|DB-Server-Web-Application-Response|Repudiation|Attacker can deny the malicious act and remove the attack foot prints leading to repudiation issues|Proper logging of all security events and user actions builds traceability in a system and denies any possible repudiation issues. In the absence of proper auditing and logging controls, it would become impossible to implement any accountability in a system
|15|DB-Server-Web-Application-Response|Spoofing|An adversary can spoof the target web application due to insecure TLS certificate configuration|Ensure that TLS certificate parameters are configured with correct values
|16|DB-Server-Web-Application-Response|Spoofing|An adversary can steal sensitive data like user credentials|Attackers can exploit weaknesses in system to steal user credentials. Downstream and upstream components are often accessed by using credentials stored in configuration stores. Attackers may steal the upstream or downstream component credentials. Attackers may steal credentials if, Credentials are stored and sent in clear text, Weak input validation coupled with dynamic sql queries, Password retrieval mechanism are poor
|17|DB-Server-Web-Application-Response|Tampering|An adversary can gain access to sensitive data by performing SQL injection through Web App|SQL injection is an attack in which malicious code is inserted into strings that are later passed to an instance of SQL Server for parsing and execution. The primary form of SQL injection consists of direct insertion of code into user-input variables that are concatenated with SQL commands and executed. A less direct attack injects malicious code into strings that are destined for storage in a table or as metadata. When the stored strings are subsequently concatenated into a dynamic SQL command, the malicious code is executed. 
|18|DB-Server-Web-Application-Response|Tampering|An adversary can gain access to sensitive data stored in Web App's config files|An adversary can gain access to the config files. and if sensitive data is stored in it, it would be compromised.
|19|Web-Application-DB-Server-Request|Elevation of Privileges|An adversary can gain unauthorized access to Azure SQL database due to weak account policy|Due to poorly configured account policies, adversary can launch brute force attacks on PostgreSQL Database 
|20|Web-Application-DB-Server-Request|Elevation of Privileges|An adversary can gain unauthorized access to Azure SQL DB instances due to weak network security configuration.|An adversary can gain unauthorized access to Azure SQL DB instances due to weak network security configuration.
|21|Web-Application-DB-Server-Request|Information Disclosure|An adversary can read confidential data due to weak connection string configuration|An adversary can read confidential data due to weak connection string configuration
|22|Web-Application-DB-Server-Request|Information Disclosure|An adversary having access to the storage container (e.g. physical access to the storage media) may be able to read sensitive data|An adversary having access to the storage container (e.g. physical access to the storage media) may be able to read sensitive data
|23|Web-Application-DB-Server-Request|Repudiation|An adversary can deny actions performed on PostgreSQL Database due to a lack of auditing|An adversary can deny actions performed on PostgreSQL Database due to a lack of auditing
